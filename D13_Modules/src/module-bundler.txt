// Module Bundling

// Task 8

What is JavaScript Bundler?
A module bundler provides a method for arranging and merging multiple JavaScript files into a unified single file.
It is used when the project becomes bigger and/or dealing with libraries with numerous dependencies, 
so that client or browser doesn't have to fetch numerous files individually.

I have used webpack package bundler to bundle the JavaScript files.

Concepts:
- Entry - Entry file (.js).
- Output - Where to store the output (bundled code).
- Loader - Loaders for different types of inputs. (css-loader for .css files).
- Mode - Production or Development.
- Plugins - Different types of plugins. (IgnorePlugin to ignore certain modules).

The process:
- It first takes one or more entry file (.js) to begine the bundling process.
- Then, by tracking every line of code, it builts the dependacy tree of all the files, assets, etc.
  that are required for that entry file to execute. 
- Then, it traverses that dependancy tree and adds more files, assets, etc. 
  to the dependancy tree by going into respective modules.
- It only takes the elements liked functions, objects, etc of the module that are actually being used or imported in the main js file.
